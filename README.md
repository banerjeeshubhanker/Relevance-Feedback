# Relevance Feedback using Rocchio's algorithm

The objective of this project is to implement an information retrieval system which uses Doc2vec to present the search results which are most relevant to the query.
The IR system will get a search query from the user and the response will be "n" number of results ordered from most relevant to least.
Queries are fed to the system which involves a similarity classifier which returns the results based on the score in descending order. Furthermore, users are given the option to select relevant documents and this selection is used to refine the retrieval process using rocchio's algorithm.
