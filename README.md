# Information Retrieval System using TF-IDF

The objective of this project is to implement an information retrieval system which uses Doc2vec to present the search results which are most relevant to the query.
The IR system will get a search query from the user and the response will be "n" number of results ordered from most relevant to least.
Queries are fed to a IR system within which a similarity classifier which returns the results based on the score in descending order.
